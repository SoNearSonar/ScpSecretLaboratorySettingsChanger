## Features:

- Set spawn preferences for your favorite SCP entities

## Note:
- This application requires the game [SCP: Secret Laboratory](https://store.steampowered.com/app/700330/SCP_Secret_Laboratory/) to be installed so it can read the games "registry.txt" file which has the information for these settings.
